# This file will hard mask all the Ada packages in ::gentoo, for some reason,
# any eix-sync or emerge will cause the following error to be displayed:
#
# --- Invalid atom in <path-to>/ada-overlay/profiles/package.mask: dev-ada/*::gentoo
# --- Invalid atom in <path-to>/ada-overlay/profiles/package.mask: dev-lang/gnat-gpl::gentoo
#
# I don't know why, any other attempt doesn't mask the packages. The complaint
# seems to be the "::gentoo" part.
#
# If anyone knows how to fix this, please send a PR, thanks.

# Disable all of the dev-ada::gentoo packages

dev-ada/*::gentoo

# Also disable GNAT-GPL.

dev-lang/gnat-gpl::gentoo
